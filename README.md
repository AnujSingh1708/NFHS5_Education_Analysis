# 📊 NFHS-5 Education Analysis (India)

This project analyzes key indicators from the NFHS-5 (National Family Health Survey) dataset, focusing on **education** and **gender equity**.

---

## 🔍 What I Did:
- Cleaned and reshaped government health survey data using R (`tidyverse`)
- Visualized **female school attendance** across Indian states
- Compared **state-wise sex ratios** (females per 1000 males)
- Highlighted **India's national average** in all plots for context

---

## 🌟 Key Insights:
- States like **Kerala** and **Goa** show **high female school attendance**, while **Bihar** and **Rajasthan** lag behind.
- Several northern states reflect **lower sex ratios**, suggesting potential gender bias in birth/health outcomes.
- These visual insights can inform **policy decisions**, **targeted interventions**, and further research.

## 🧰 Tools Used:
- **R** (tidyverse, ggplot2)
- Data cleaning, EDA, and custom bar plots
- Static PNG plots for clean visual storytelling
